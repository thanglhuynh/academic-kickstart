# Biography

I am a S.E.W. assistant professor (aka postdoc) in the Department of Mathematics at University of California at San Diego. I received my B.Sc. in Mathematics from St Lawrence University in 2010 and Ph.D. from Courant Institute, New York University, in 2016.

My research interests broadly fall within mathematical signal processing and machine learning. More specifically, I have studied quantization theory and analog-to-digital conversion methods with particular emphasis on the settings of frame theory, compressed sensing, and phase retrieval. I have utilized techniques from random matrix theory, applied harmonic analysis, and optimization to attack problems from such settings. 

I am especially fond of dimensionality reduction and randomized algorithms.
