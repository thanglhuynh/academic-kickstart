# Biography

I am a postdoctoral associate in the Chair of Mathematics of Information Processing, RWTH Aachen University. Before that,
I was a S.E.W. assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics at University of California at San Diego. I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from [Courant Institute, New York University](https://cims.nyu.edu/) in 2016, and my B.Sc. in Mathematics from [St Lawrence University](https://www.stlawu.edu/math-computer-science-and-statistics) in 2010.

My research interests broadly fall within mathematical signal processing and machine learning. More specifically, I have studied quantization theory and analog-to-digital conversion methods with particular emphasis on the settings of frame theory, compressed sensing, and phase retrieval. I have utilized techniques from random matrix theory, applied harmonic analysis, and optimization to attack problems from such settings. 

I am especially fond of dimensionality reduction and data compression.
