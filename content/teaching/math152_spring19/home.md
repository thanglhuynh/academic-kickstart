#### Catalog Description: 
We will cover among other topics (tentative): sampling, finding frequent items, counting distinct elements, general frequency moment estimation, finding frequent item sets, dimensionality reduction, and matrix approximation.

Textbooks: There is no course textbook. We will primarily be following [Edo Liberty's course notes](https://edoliberty.github.io/datamining2013a.html), and [Jelani Nelson's](https://www.sketchingbigdata.org/). I will post a reference for each lecture.
