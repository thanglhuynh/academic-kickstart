**Course:**  Math 20E

**Title:** Vector Calculus

**Credit Hours:** 4 units

**Prerequisite:** Math 20C (or Math 21C) or Math 31BH with a grade of C- or better.

**Catalog Description:** Change of variable in multiple integrals, Jacobian, Line integrals, Green's theorem. Vector fields, gradient fields, divergence, curl. Spherical/cylindrical coordinates. Taylor series in several variables. Surface integrals, Stoke's theorem. Conservative fields.

**Textbook:** *Vector Calculus, sixth edition*, by Jerrold E. Marsden and Anthony J. Tromba; published by W. H. Freeman and Company; 2012. The Student Solutions Manual is optional.

**Subject Material:** We will cover parts of chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the text. (See the [homework page](https://www.thanghuynh.io/teaching/math20e_spring2019/homework/) for a complete listing of sections we will cover.)

**Lecture:** Attending the lecture is a fundamental part of the course; you are responsible for all material presented in the lecture whether or not it is discussed in the textbook. You should expect questions on the exams that will test your understanding of concepts discussed in the lecture.

**Reading:** Reading the sections of the textbook corresponding to the assigned homework exercises is considered part of the homework assignment; you are responsible for material in the assigned reading whether or not it is discussed in the lecture. It will be expected that you read the assigned material in advance of each lecture.

**Homework:** Homework will be assigned on the course homework page and should be completed by 11:59pm on the indicated due date. To submit your homework, [click here to see the instruction](https://www.thanghuynh.io/teaching/math20e_spring2019/homework/). *Late homework will not be accepted.*

**Midterm Exams:** There will be two (2) midterm exams. (See also the course [calendar](https://www.thanghuynh.io/teaching/math20e_spring2019/calendar/)). You may bring a ONE SIDED 8.5 by 11 inch handwritten sheet of notes with you to each midterm exam. No calculators will be allowed.  There will be no makeup exams.

**Final Exam:** The final examination will be held at the following date and time.

   * June 10 from 8am - 11am (See the course [calendar](https://www.thanghuynh.io/teaching/math20e_spring2019/calendar/).)  
     * Please note:  
       * *It is your responsibility to ensure that you do not have a schedule conflict involving the final examination.*  
       * *You should not enroll in this class if you cannot sit for the final examination at its scheduled time.* 
   * You may bring one 8.5 by 11 inch handwritten sheet of notes with you to the final examination (BOTH SIDES OF THE SHEET MAY BE USED FOR THE FINAL EXAM). No calculators will be allowed.  

**Regrades:** Midterm exams will be returned in the discussion sections. If you wish to have your exam regraded, you must observe the following rules:  

   * Return your exam immediately to your TA. Regrade requests will not be considered once the exam leaves the room.  
   * If you disagree with the TA's answer to your regrade request, you may ask for the instructor to review it. In order to do this, you must return your exam immediately to your TA and ask that they forward it to the instructor.  
   * Instructor review requests will not be considered once the exam leaves the room.  
   * If you do not retrieve your exam during discussion section, you must arrange to pick it up from your TA within one week after it was returned in order for any regrade request to be considered.  

**Calculators:** A graphing calculator (e.g., TI-83, TI-84, or TI-89) is recommended for homework assignments and as an aid in learning concepts. *The use of calculators will NOT be permitted during exams.*  

**Grading:** Your course grade will be determined by your cumulative average at the end of the term and will be based on the following scale:  

<center>        
<table class="grades" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>A+</b></td>
<td><b>A</b></td>
<td><b>A-</b></td>
<td><b>B+</b></td>
<td><b>B</b></td>
<td><b>B-</b></td>
<td><b>C+</b></td>
<td><b>C</b></td>
<td><b>C-</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>97</b></td>
<td><b>93</b></td>
<td><b>90</b></td>
<td><b>87</b></td>
<td><b>83</b></td>
<td><b>80</b></td>
<td><b>77</b></td>
<td><b>73</b></td>
<td><b>70</b></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</center>


I may adjust the scale to be more lenient, but guarantee that the grade corresponding to a given percentage will not be lower than specified by the above scale. Your cumulative average will be the best of the following two weighted averages:  

* 20% Homework,  20% Midterm Exam I,  20% Midterm Exam II,  40% Final Exam  
* 20% Homework,  20% Best Midterm,  60% Final Exam  

You must pass the final examination in order to pass the course. Note: Since *there are no makeup exams*, if you miss an exam for any reason then your course grade will be computed with the final exam counting 60% of your weighted average.

**Academic Dishonesty:** Academic dishonesty is considered a serious offense at UCSD. Students caught cheating will face an administrative sanction which may include suspension or expulsion from the university. Click here for more information.
