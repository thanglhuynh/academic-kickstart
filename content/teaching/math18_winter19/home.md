## Course Information  
  * **Textbook**: The required textbook for this course is *Linear Algebra and its Applications*, w/ MyMathLab, by David C. Lay, Steven R. Lay, and Judi J. McDonald. This is the textbook available at the UC San Diego bookstore. If you choose to purchase it elsewhere, be aware that **you need MyMathLab access**, which is included with the bookstore version of the textbook but not with all versions. **Note**: you may also forego the physical textbook and just purchase a MyMathLab access code directly from MyMathLab the first time you login (see TritonEd below); this includes access to the ebook version of the textbook.  
  * **TritonEd & MyMathLab**: We will use [TritonEd](https://tritoned.ucsd.edu/) for two purposes in this class: to disseminate grades, and as a portal to MyMathLab, the online homework system associated to the textbook, through which you will submit your homework. In the course page on TritonEd, you can click on MyLab in the right tab. There you will see links to Pearson MyMathLab. The first time you login, you will be prompted to create an account with Pearson, and then enter the access code that came with your textbook (or purchase one here). This is a one-time procedure; after that every time you login will give you direct access to MyMathLab. There you will find all currently available homework assignments, along with their listed due dates. You will also have access to the ebook version of the textbook here (for the lifetime of the current edition).
  * **Homework**: There are two kinds of homework for this course. There will be (approximately) weekly MyMathLab assignments which you will submit online. The assignments can be found in your [TritonEd](https://tritoned.ucsd.edu/) account, under MyLab, as described above. 
There are also accompanying textbook homework problems, which can be found [here](https://www.thanghuynh.io/teaching/math18_winter19/homework/). These problems are not to be turned in and will not be graded; however, it is often the case that exam questions may be based on problems like the ones you'll find here, so it is to your benefit to work on them!
  * **MATLAB**: One component of our coursework is a series of [MATLAB](http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~math18/) exercises. You will sign up for a MATLAB section and submit your MATLAB work through gradescope. All information releventt to the MATLAB component of Math 18 can be found [here](http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~math18/).
  * **Exams**: There will be two midterm exams and a final exam; Check the Calendar for dates, times, and locations. Note that there will be no make-up dates for the midterms or the final exam. They were scheduled before you signed up for the class. If you cannot take the final exam at its scheduled time, you should not enroll in this class.  
  * **Piazza**: We will use [Piazza](piazza.com/ucsd/winter2019/math18lecturec/home), an online discussion board. It will allow you to post messages (openly or anonymously) and answer posts made by your fellow students, about course content, homework, exams, etc. The instructors will also monitor and post to Piazza regularly. You can sign up ]here](piazza.com/ucsd/winter2019/math18lecturec) if you are not already signed up.
