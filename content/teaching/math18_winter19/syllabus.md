**Course**:  Math 18

**Title**:  Linear Algebra

**Credit Hours**:  4  (Students may not receive credit for both Math 18 and 31AH.)

**Prerequisite**:  Math Placement Exam qualifying score, or AP Calculus AB score of 2, or SAT II Math Level 2 score of 600 or higher, or Math 3C, or Math 4C, or Math 10A, or Math 20A, or consent of instructor.

**Catalog Description**:  Matrix algebra, Gaussian elimination, determinants, Linear and affine subspaces, bases of Euclidean spaces. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors, quadratic forms, orthogonal matrices, diagonalization of symmetric matrices. Applications. Computing symbolic and graphical solutions using Matlab. See the [UC San Diego Course Catalog](https://ucsd.edu/catalog/courses/MATH.html).

**Textbook**: Linear Algebra and its Applications, by David C. Lay, Steven R. Lay, and Judi J. McDonald; published by Pearson (Addison Wesley).

**Subject Material**:  We will cover parts of chapters 1-7 of the text.

**Lecture**:  Attending the lecture is a fundamental part of the course; you are responsible for material presented in the lecture whether or not it is discussed in the textbook.  You should expect questions on the exams that will test your understanding of concepts discussed in the lecture.

**Reading**:  Reading the sections of the textbook corresponding to the assigned homework exercises is considered part of the homework assignment; you are responsible for material in the assigned reading whether or not it is discussed in the lecture.

**Homework**:  Homework is a very important part of the course and in order to fully master the topics it is essential that you work carefully on every assignment and try your best to complete every problem. We will have two different kinds of homework assignments in this class: online homework (which will be graded) and "paper-and-pen" homework (which will not be graded).
  * Online homework will be assigned through MyMathLab and will be accessible via TritonEd.
    * Unless otherwise stated, you have unlimited attempts at each homework problem.
    * Your total homework score will be based on the total possible homework points available; no homework assignment scores will be dropped at the end of the quarter.
    * Homework should be turned in on time. Extensions may be given in some cases with a small window after the deadline, but typically homework turned in after the deadline will score at most 50% of the total points on the assignment.
  * The "paper-and-pen" homework assignments will be announced on the course homework page. These assignments will not be turned in and will not be graded; however, you are responsible for the ideas illustrated by these exercises and exam questions could be based on them.

**MATLAB**:   In applications of linear algebra, the theoretical concepts that you will learn in lecture are used together 
with computers to solve large scale problems.  Thus, in addition to your written homework, you will be required to do homework 
using the computer language MATLAB. The Math 18 MATLAB Assignments page contains all information relevant to the MATLAB 
component of Math 18. The first assignment is due in week 2 of the course.  You can do the homework on any campus computer 
that has MATLAB.  Questions regarding the MATLAB assignments should be directed to the TAs.  There are also tutors available 
beginning Thursday or Friday of the first week of classes in B432 of AP&M.  Please turn in your homework via Gradescope, 
as described on the MATLAB page, by 11:59pm on the indicated due date (as indicated on the Math 18 MATLAB Assignments page). 
In general, MATLAB homework will be accepted up to 48 hours after the deadline, but a 10% late penalty will be assessed if it 
is not uploaded before the deadline. In case you have to miss one MATLAB assignment, your lowest MATLAB homework score will 
be dropped.  There will be a MATLAB quiz at the end of the quarter.

**Midterm Exams**:  There will be two midterm exams given during the quarter. You may bring one 8.5 by 11 inch sheet of paper 
with handwritten notes (on both sides) with you to each midterm exam; no other notes (or books) will be allowed. 
*No calculators, phones, or other electronic devices will be allowed during the midterm exams. There will be no makeup exams.*

**Final Examination**:  The final examination will be held at the date and time stated above.
  * It is your responsibility to ensure that you do not have a schedule conflict involving the final examination; you should not 
enroll in this class if you cannot take the final examination at its scheduled time.
  * You may bring two 8.5 by 11 inch sheets of paper with handwritten notes (on both sides) with you to the final examination; no other notes (or books) will be allowed.
  * No calculators, phones, or other electronic devices will be allowed during the final examination. **There will be no makeup final exam.**

**Regrade Policy**:  Your exams and MATLAB homework will be graded using [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/). 
You will be able to request a regrade directly from your TA for a specified window of time.  Be sure to make your request 
within the specified window of time; no regrade requests will be accepted after the deadline.

**Administrative Deadline**:  Your scores for all graded work will be posted to TritonEd.
  * It is your responsibility to check your scores and contact your TA **before the end of the 10th week** of the quarter to resolve recording errors.
  * Questions regarding missing or incorrectly recorded scores **will not be considered after the last day of instruction**.

**Grading**: Your course grade will be determined by your cumulative average at the end of the term and will be based on the 
following scale:
