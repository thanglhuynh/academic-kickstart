**Textbook**: Linear Algebra and its Applications, by David C. Lay, Steven R. Lay, and Judi J. McDonald; published by Pearson (Addison Wesley).

**Subject Material**:  We will cover parts of chapters 1-7 of the text.

**Lecture**:  Attending the lecture is a fundamental part of the course; you are responsible for material presented in the lecture whether or not it is discussed in the textbook.  You should expect questions on the exams that will test your understanding of concepts discussed in the lecture.

**Reading**:  Reading the sections of the textbook corresponding to the assigned homework exercises is considered part of the homework assignment; you are responsible for material in the assigned reading whether or not it is discussed in the lecture.

**Homework**:  Homework is a very important part of the course and in order to fully master the topics it is essential that you work carefully on every assignment and try your best to complete every problem. We will have two different kinds of homework assignments in this class: online homework (which will be graded) and "paper-and-pen" homework (which will not be graded). 

  * Online homework will be assigned through MyMathLab and will be accessible via TritonEd.
  
    * Unless otherwise stated, you have unlimited attempts at each homework problem. 
    * Your total homework score will be based on the total possible homework points available; no homework assignment scores will be dropped at the end of the quarter.
    * Homework should be turned in on time. Extensions may be given in some cases with a small window after the deadline, but typically homework turned in after the deadline will score at most 50% of the total points on the assignment.
  * The "paper-and-pen" homework assignments will be announced on the course homework page. These assignments will not be turned in and will not be graded; however, you are responsible for the ideas illustrated by these exercises and exam questions could be based on them.

**MATLAB**:   In applications of linear algebra, the theoretical concepts that you will learn in lecture are used together 
with computers to solve large scale problems.  Thus, in addition to your written homework, you will be required to do homework 
using the computer language MATLAB. The Math 18 MATLAB Assignments page contains all information relevant to the MATLAB 
component of Math 18. The first assignment is due in week 2 of the course.  You can do the homework on any campus computer 
that has MATLAB.  Questions regarding the MATLAB assignments should be directed to the TAs.  There are also tutors available 
beginning Thursday or Friday of the first week of classes in B432 of AP&M.  Please turn in your homework via Gradescope, 
as described on the MATLAB page, by 11:59pm on the indicated due date (as indicated on the Math 18 MATLAB Assignments page). 
In general, MATLAB homework will be accepted up to 48 hours after the deadline, but a 10% late penalty will be assessed if it 
is not uploaded before the deadline. In case you have to miss one MATLAB assignment, your lowest MATLAB homework score will 
be dropped.  There will be a MATLAB quiz at the end of the quarter.

**Midterm Exams**:  There will be two midterm exams given during the quarter. You may bring one 8.5 by 11 inch sheet of paper 
with handwritten notes (on both sides) with you to each midterm exam; no other notes (or books) will be allowed. 
*No calculators, phones, or other electronic devices will be allowed during the midterm exams. There will be no makeup exams.*

**Final Examination**:  The final examination will be held at the date and time stated above.
  * It is your responsibility to ensure that you do not have a schedule conflict involving the final examination; you should not 
enroll in this class if you cannot take the final examination at its scheduled time.
  * You may bring two 8.5 by 11 inch sheets of paper with handwritten notes (on both sides) with you to the final examination; no other notes (or books) will be allowed.
  * No calculators, phones, or other electronic devices will be allowed during the final examination. **There will be no makeup final exam.**

**Regrade Policy**:  Your exams and MATLAB homework will be graded using [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/). 
You will be able to request a regrade directly from your TA for a specified window of time.  Be sure to make your request 
within the specified window of time; no regrade requests will be accepted after the deadline.

**Administrative Deadline**:  Your scores for all graded work will be posted to TritonEd.  
  * It is your responsibility to check your scores and contact your TA **before the end of the 10th week** of the quarter to resolve recording errors. 
  * Questions regarding missing or incorrectly recorded scores **will not be considered after the last day of instruction**.

**Grading**: Your course grade will be determined by your cumulative average at the end of the term and will be based on the 
following scale:
<center>        
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="tableBody"><b>A+</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>A</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>A-</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>B+</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>B</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>B-</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>C+</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>C</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>C-</b></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tableBody"><b>97</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>93</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>90</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>87</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>83</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>80</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>77</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>73</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>70</b></td>

</tr>
</tbody>       
</table>
</center>

**Note**:  The above scale is guaranteed: for example, if your cumulative average is 80, your final grade will be at least B-. However, your instructor may adjust the above scale to be more generous. 

Your cumulative average will be the best of the following two weighted averages: 
  * 10% MATLAB (5% homework and 5% quiz, or 10% homework, whichever is greater), 10% Homework,  20% Midterm Exam I,  20% Midterm Exam II,  40% Final Exam 
  * 10% MATLAB (5% homework and 5% quiz, or 10% homework, whichever is greater), 10% Homework,  20% Best Midterm Exam,  60% Final Exam 

In addition,  you must pass the final examination in order to pass the course.  Note: Since there are no makeup exams, if you miss a midterm exam for any reason, then your course grade will be computed with the second option. There are no exceptions; this grading scheme is intended to accommodate emergencies that require missing a midterm exam.

**Academic Integrity**:  UC San Diego's [code of academic integrity](https://students.ucsd.edu/academics/academic-integrity/index.html) outlines the expected academic honesty of all students and faculty, and details the consequences for academic dishonesty. The main issues are cheating and plagiarism, of course, for which we have a zero-tolerance policy. (Penalties for these offenses always include assignment of a failing grade in the course, and usually involve an administrative penalty, such as suspension or expulsion, as well.) However, academic integrity also includes things like giving credit where credit is due, and treating your peers respectfully in class. In addition, here are a few of our expectations for etiquette in and out of class.

  * **Entering/exiting class**: Please arrive on time and stay for the entire class/section period. If, despite your best efforts, you arrive late, please enter quietly through the rear door and take a seat near where you entered. Similarly, in the rare event that you must leave early (e.g. for a medical appointment), please sit close to the rear exit and leave as unobtrusively as possible.
  * **Noise and common courtesy**: When class/section begins, please stop your conversations. Wait until class/section is over before putting your materials away in your backpack, standing up, or talking to friends. Do not disturb others by engaging in disruptive behavior. Disruption interferes with the learning environment and impairs the ability of others to focus, participate, and engage. 
  * **Electronic devices**: Please do not use devices (such as cell phones, laptops, tablets, iPods) for non-class-related matters while in class/section. No visual or audio recording is allowed in class/section without prior permission of the instructor (whether by camera, cell phone, or other means). 
  * **E-mail etiquette**: You are expected to write as you would in any professional correspondence. E-mail communication should be courteous and respectful in manner and tone. Please do not send e-mails that are curt or demanding.

**Accommodations**: Students requesting accommodations for this course due to a disability must provide a current Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter issued by the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD) which is located in University Center 202 behind Center Hall. Students are required to present their AFA letters to the instructor (please make arrangements to contact your instructor privately) and to the OSD Liaison in the department in advance (by the end of Week 2, if possible) so that accommodations may be arranged.
