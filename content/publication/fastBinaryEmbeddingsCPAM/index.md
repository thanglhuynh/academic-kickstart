abstract = "This paper deals with two related problems, namely distance-preserving binary embeddings and quantization for compressed sensing. First, we propose fast methods to replace points from a subset $X \subset R^n$, , associated with the Euclidean metric, with points in the cube and we associate the cube with a pseudo-metric that approximates Euclidean distance among points in $X$."
